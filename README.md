### 1. Overview
It is with great pleasure that I extend a warm welcome to you as you embark on a journey through my digital repository, encapsulating my academic and professional pursuits in the field of computer science. Within these virtual confines, you will find a meticulously curated collection of projects, reflections, and insights that underscore my dedication to advancing the frontiers of technological innovation.

#### Introduction:
My name is Alexa Szlykowicz, and I am honored to present this ePortfolio as a testament to my unwavering commitment to excellence in computer science. With a fervent passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, I have dedicated myself to honing my skills, expanding my knowledge, and making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of computing.

#### Mission Statement:
This ePortfolio serves as a testament to my relentless pursuit of mastery and my steadfast belief in the transformative power of technology. Through a combination of technical acumen, creative ingenuity, and ethical responsibility, I endeavor to develop solutions that not only push the boundaries of possibility but also uphold the principles of integrity, inclusivity, and social responsibility.

### 2. Self-Assessment

Completing coursework for an ePortfolio has been invaluable in showcasing my strengths, honing professional goals, and refining values essential for success in the computer science field. By documenting my projects, achievements, and reflections, I've demonstrated proficiency, adaptability, and a growth mindset, essential traits in this dynamic industry. This process has not only solidified my technical skills, but also enhanced my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving abilities, making me a well-rounded candidate poised for success in the computer science realm.

My repertoire extends beyond the projects highlighted in this ePortfolio. Among my endeavors, I have programmed a 3D pyramid with textured rendering utilizing OpenGL. Additionally, I possess proficiency in SQL, having executed various queries on database systems. I have acquired proficiency in Python programming and have recently embarked on a journey to master JavaScript. While my expertise predominantly lies in Java, I remain fervently committed to advancing my skills in Python. Furthermore, I have engaged in Android application development and acquired knowledge in JUnit testing and system security measures. Notably, I have gained competence in training AI models through Jupyter Notebook.

#### **Collaborating in a Team Environment**
In this ePortfolio, I have included a Code Review. The Code Review demonstrates my ability to collaborate with a team. Code Reviews are an opportunity for developers to work together in finding errors, missing components, or insecurities in the code. 

**Communicating with Stakeholders**
This Self-Assessment is the initial step in engaging with stakeholders. It's a vital part of my ePortfolio, which I can use to demonstrate my capabilities to them. Essentially, it's about laying the groundwork for sharing my skills and aspirations. Since it's an integral component of my ePortfolio, it significantly enhances what I can showcase to stakeholders, providing them with a clearer understanding of my strengths. 

**Datastructures and Algorithms**
My expertise in data structures and algorithms enables me to design efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization. In software engineering, I adhere to best practices and methodologies to deliver high-quality, maintainable code that meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

With a strong background in database management, I ensure data integrity, availability, and security, implementing robust database designs and efficient query optimization techniques. Security is paramount, and I proactively address potential vulnerabilities, implementing layers of defense to safeguard against threats and protect sensitive information.
