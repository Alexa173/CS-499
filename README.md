#### Enhancements

This artifact is a text-based game that was originally developed in Python. The Python version uses a dictionary to create a map of neighboring planets that the player must visit while collecting its artifacts. The Java version uses nested HashMaps to create the map. The player must enter the correct command to be able to move between the planets and collect items. I also included necessary checks to prevent the program from crashing when the user enters invalid information. Here is a list of enhancements:

1. Better error message display (Python on the left, Java on the right)

### 5. Algorithms and Data structures

#### Artifact Two

This section covers Article Two. This is the third milestone and the second enhancement. This project is align with the course outcome:

- One out come that this enhancement will be aligned with is being able to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

This current code implements a menu that allows a user to insert a bid from a csv file, view the contents of the csv file, and to perform a selection sort on that dataset. I enhanced this project by improving the efficiency of the software. I did this by adding a quicksort algorithm option to the menu. The current use of selection sort yields a O(n^2) performance. Adding a quicksort option should yield a O (n log(n)) performance. Here is a list of enhancements:

#### Enhancements: 

1. Use the quicksort method to improve time complexity.

### 6. Databases

#### Artifact Three

This section covers Artifact 3. This is my fourth milestone and the third enhancement. This project is aligned with course outcome:

- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

Artifact 3 is a single-page application that uses a MEAN stack for development. Here, I create a SPA for a ficticious client named Travlr. The original code uses Express and Node to build a static SPA. The client makes HTTP requests to fetch static HTML content.  The updated architecture of the Travlr GetAways is based on a MEAN stack for its development. A MEAN stack is composed of a Rest API, JSON files, and a single-page application. Restful API provides a stateless interface for the database. On the customer-facing side of the application, the user enters data or makes a click on the website. In an Angular SPA, there is a collection of URLs that fetch data when prompted by the user. 

Here is what the static HTML page looks like:

<img width="500" alt="Static HTML" src="https://github.com/Alexa173/CS-499/assets/131563077/e0be7ba6-3d5b-4e29-b7fc-fe9a05692b46">

Here are the list of enhancements:

#### Enhancements

1. Update the structure to incorporate the api. This folder is called app_api.
2. Create a Mongoose schema
3. Add a router for the API to function
4. Wire up the route to the controller

Here is a screenshot of me testing the api call and retrieving all trips using Postman:
