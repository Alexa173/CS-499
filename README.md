### 1. Overview
It is with great pleasure that I extend a warm welcome to you as you embark on a journey through my digital repository, encapsulating my academic and professional pursuits in the field of computer science. Within these virtual confines, you will find a meticulously curated collection of projects, reflections, and insights that underscore my dedication to advancing the frontiers of technological innovation.

#### Introduction:
My name is Alexa Szlykowicz, and I am honored to present this ePortfolio as a testament to my unwavering commitment to excellence in computer science. With a fervent passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, I have dedicated myself to honing my skills, expanding my knowledge, and making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of computing.

#### Mission Statement:
This ePortfolio serves as a testament to my relentless pursuit of mastery and my steadfast belief in the transformative power of technology. Through a combination of technical acumen, creative ingenuity, and ethical responsibility, I endeavor to develop solutions that not only push the boundaries of possibility but also uphold the principles of integrity, inclusivity, and social responsibility.

### 2. Self-Assessment

Completing coursework for an ePortfolio has been invaluable in showcasing my strengths, honing professional goals, and refining values essential for success in the computer science field. By documenting my projects, achievements, and reflections, I've demonstrated proficiency, adaptability, and a growth mindset, essential traits in this dynamic industry. This process has not only solidified my technical skills, but also enhanced my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving abilities, making me a well-rounded candidate poised for success in the computer science realm.

My repertoire extends beyond the projects highlighted in this ePortfolio. Among my endeavors, I have programmed a 3D pyramid with textured rendering utilizing OpenGL. Additionally, I possess proficiency in SQL, having executed various queries on database systems. I have acquired proficiency in Python programming and have recently embarked on a journey to master JavaScript. While my expertise predominantly lies in Java, I remain fervently committed to advancing my skills in Python. Furthermore, I have engaged in Android application development and acquired knowledge in JUnit testing and system security measures. Notably, I have gained competence in training AI models through Jupyter Notebook.

#### **Collaborating in a Team Environment**
In this ePortfolio, I have included a Code Review. The Code Review demonstrates my ability to collaborate with a team. Code Reviews are an opportunity for developers to work together in finding errors, missing components, or insecurities in the code. 

#### **Communicating with Stakeholders**
This Self-Assessment is the initial step in engaging with stakeholders. It's a vital part of my ePortfolio, which I can use to demonstrate my capabilities to them. Essentially, it's about laying the groundwork for sharing my skills and aspirations. Since it's an integral component of my ePortfolio, it significantly enhances what I can showcase to stakeholders, providing them with a clearer understanding of my strengths. 

#### **Data structures and Algorithms**
Artifact Two offers insight into my proficiency with data structures and algorithms. Within this artifact, I demonstrate the application of two sorting algorithms: selection sort and quicksort, to efficiently organize data sets. Through this showcase, I illustrate my understanding of fundamental algorithms and their practical implementation in sorting tasks.

#### **Software Engineering and Databases**
Artifact One illustrates my understanding of software engineering. Artifact Three displays my knowledge in Databases. Artifact One provides a comprehensive view of my grasp of software engineering principles. Within this artifact, I showcase my ability to design, develop, and manage software projects effectively. Through Artifact Three, I offer a demonstration of my expertise in database management. I showcase my knowledge of database technologies, query languages, and data modeling techniques.

#### **Security**
In Artifact Three, I develop a security mindset by incorporating a RESTful API that retrieves data from database stored in MongoDB. A RESTful API provides a small layer of security by allowing authentication mechanisms to prevent server hijackings. 

Each of these artifacts aligns with and effectively addresses the five course outcomes established for my Capstone project. These outcomes serve as benchmarks to evaluate the depth and breadth of my learning and practical application of skills throughout the course.

The following sections contain Artifact One, Two, and Three. Following each artifact will be a narrative reflecting on the enhancement process. Each section will contain a link to its respective project.
